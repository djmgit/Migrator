Migrator is a CLI based tool for easy and flexible migration of kafka topic partions to given set of brokers
Migrator can used to easily move topic partions without using those long kakfa commands. Also it displays reassignment
data in simple and easy to understand/edit table format. It replaces those largy kafka-cli commands with short
and crisp commands.

  forget a parameter. No need to go back and search the kafka doc or lookup your history and copy that huge command.
